# Reproducibility Guide

In this folder, we provide the codes and the link to the processed labeled dataset of this project. <br>

The data can be downloaded from this [**link**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/152SPVDyGgWmKyslWacTM4tLeYTRvMQPg?usp=sharing). <br> <br>


The dataset is provided in three folders: <br>

### [Original Damage Scenarios](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z12XTpZ16RhSGCv3Co-Ge8BNYXTvoXa7?usp=sharing)

<div align="justify"> In this folder, we provide data for 1,000 damage scenarios based on simulated seismic scenarios with magnitude m={6,7,8,9} (4,000 scenarios in total). The seismic scenarios are computed based on the earthquake catalog of the area encompassing Shelby Count, TN. The data is given as input to td-INDP for T=20 time-steps. We provide similar data sheets given number of resources R<sub>c</sub>={2,3,...,8}.
